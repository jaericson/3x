# TODOs
* DONE change fancy printf stuffs done in exp-plan to `column -t`
* DONE exp-results
    * run restriction
    * condition restrcition
    * Consider using sqlite or relying on some relational store w/ SQL, i.e., don't be too fancy with the selection
* DONE exp-results bug fix for empty args
* DONE exp-results query on measurements (=/</>/<=/>=)
* DONE exp-plan with the output of exp-results query (e.g., when you want to rerun exps for certain conditions with failures/anomalies/etc.)

* Options for declaring new ones for `exp conditions` and `exp measurements`
* a simple way to bootstrap an exp repository

        exp setup  VAR1=V1,V2  VAR2=V3,V4..V5 ...  'COMMAND'  MEASURE1='PATT1_FROM_OUTPUT'  MEASURE2='PATT2_FROM_OUTPUT' ...

* exp stop for stopping a running batch or run
* keep links to currently running batch and/or run

* better messaging: let exp.sh dup terminal fds, so all msg can still reach the term

* `exp measure` for running newly added measures: requires partial assembly for exp.measure, and separating the running part from exp-run.
* exp-rerun for re-running past runs: do a copy --archive --link from the run dir and simply run it again?

* better hardlinking: first create a copy if necessary in .exp/ and hardlink that one so that user can modify anything outside run/ without worrying about overwriting all the snapshots.

## GUI
* DONE chasis with express.js + node + bootstrap + coffee-script
* DONE workflow design

* DONE specifying the conditions of interest for planning and listing results
* tabulating results
    * DONE basic table
    * DONE w/ or w/o aggregation: avg, med, sum, min, max, ...
        * DONE choose aggregation function for each measurements
        * DONE aggregated values popup
    * DONE show all records if aggregation for run# is turned off
    * DONE number formatting
    * DONE numeric type cell align right
    * DONE different number precision for diff measurements (using mean of |fractional|s of the actual values)
    * DONE fill empty results for selected conditions
        * from the popup, let user easily add exp plans
    * show multiple aggregation for each measurements
    * DONE clear separation of split aggregation control and selection/filtering/projection of columns
        * aggregate/or not menuitem on conditions
        * aggregate/or not icon on table column header
        * enabled/or not menuitem on conditions
    * DONE show progress while doing ResultsTable.display
* DONE clean up navbar with scrollspy
* DONE Encapsulate with CoffeeScript classes
* d3 plots of results
    * bar chart
    * scatter plot
    * small multiple

* Title with .exp/description or basename of the $EXPROOT and ExpKitServiceBaseURL
* DONE ExpKitServiceBaseURL change option
* allow multiple instances of GUI with diff port (pid file is the singleton enforcer right now)

* easy creating/removing of condition values

* list of runs and batches
    * planning/altering a batch (mostly just ordering)
* batch page
    * monitoring running state
    * start/stop/resume
* run page
    * monitoring logs
    * better looking run summary page

* Use hash for representing GUI state as URL and using the browser history and back/forward

* DONE add right margin to icons in h2 instead of space

## Wild ideas
* temporal trends in runs
* approximation/prediction of measurements, i.e., measures without actual runs
* estimating time for a plan based on other runs: will need to keep track of
  wallclock time etc.
* concise way to specify parallel execution order in the plan
* automatic suggestion of representative condition values given a range, based
  on how each varies output (Ashish)

# TODOs
* DONE change fancy printf stuffs done in exp-plan to `column -t`
* DONE exp-results
    * run restriction
    * condition restrcition
    * Consider using sqlite or relying on some relational store w/ SQL, i.e., don't be too fancy with the selection
* DONE exp-results bug fix for empty args
* exp-results query on measurements (=/</>/<=/>=)
* exp-plan with the output of exp-results query (e.g., when you want to rerun exps for certain conditions with failures/anomalies/etc.)
* `exp measure` for running newly added measures: requires partial assembly for exp.measure, and separating the running part from exp-run.
* exp-rerun for re-running past runs: do a copy --archive --link from the run dir and simply run it again?
* better hardlinking: first create a copy if necessary in .exp/ and hardlink that one so that user can modify anything outside run/ without worrying about overwriting all the snapshots.
* keep links to currently running batch and/or run

## GUI

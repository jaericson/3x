Computational experiments are everywhere these days.  As data and information
abound at every corner of human activity, computational methods are becoming
an integral part of our intellectual endeavor.  It became crucial nowadays not
just for computer scientists or researchers who deal with computers, but also
for all kinds of engineers, physical and life scientists, and even for social
scientists to deal with series of experiments that crunch data to discover new
knowledge.

However, computational experiments are frequently done in an ad-hoc manner,
which seriously undermines their credibility.  Everyone writes his/her own set
of scripts for partially automating the execution of runs and retrieval of
results.  The produced logs and data are organized in some custom structure
that might make sense only to those who are actively engaged in the experiment.
As the experiment evolves, or after a new person joins or some time period
passes, unless extraordinary rigor had been put into it, such brittle setup
starts to break.  Changes to the computer program starts producing slightly
different output, which can trouble the scripts and the structure where they
had been recorded.  These scripts evolve as the program and data it produces,
so it is even quite difficult for the original experimenters to reproduce their
early results, let alone for others to do that.  <!-- Without a systematic
approach, Initial assumptions predetermine many parts of the experiment setup,
and flexibility is not the  so it is not trivial to incrementally change the
set of input parameters or output measures based on preliminary results.  -->

*ExpKit* is a software tool that aims to introduce a systematic approach to
computational experiments to improve their reliability, while increasing
our productivity.  ExpKit provides you a simple, yet flexible, standard
structure to organize your experiments.  Within such structure, it keeps track
of all the detailed records of your runs in an obvious and efficient way, so
that anyone can easily inspect individual traces and reproduce the results
later.  It comes with a powerful graphical user interface (GUI) that not only
visualizes the results of your experiment so far, but lets you also guide it
towards a direction that needs more exploration interactively.  Since most of
the functions regarding the management of experimental tasks and data are
exposed transparently through its command-line interface (CLI), filesystem
hierarchy and file formats, it is very simple to plug existing systems to it
and automate routine jobs on top of it.

Still, it is very important to understand that conducting a reliable
computational experiment remains a challenging problem no matter which tool you
use.  ExpKit is not some magical tool or a silver bullet, and although it
provides many scaffoldings on which you can construct reliable experiments more
easily, the quality of the experiment is ultimately up to how much rigor the
experimenter puts into it.  Our hope in building ExpKit is to make, with a
standard structure and common vocabulary, establishing a principle become much
easier, and practicing it be less burdensome.


To give you a clear picture of what ExpKit provides, let's go through several
questions using a concrete example of "comparing performance of different
sorting algorithms."

## What is a computational experiment?

Any computational experiment can be logically decomposed into three different
parts:

Programs
: These are what you want to run for your experiment.  In our example,
implementations of the different sorting algorithms will belong here, such as
bubble sort, quick sort,

Conditions
: These are the parameters of your program that you want to vary between runs.

Measures
: These are what you want to collect back from each run of your program.

ExpKit provides a well-defined structure for you to factor your experiment into
these three different categories.

## FAQ

Q. What if my experiment does not fit into ExpKit's condition/program/measure structure?
: This can happen for more complex types of experiments.
If you have multiple steps that may have dependencies between them, and
have different parameters

to produce  programs and/or data that have
dependencies between them.
ExpKit really focuses on flat experiments that have a clear input and output.
